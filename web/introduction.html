            Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web
            applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone
            technologies for the World Wide Web.

            <br><br>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
            into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
            included cues for the appearance of the document.

            <br><br>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects
            such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
            structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
            links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags
            such as &lt;img /&gt; and &lt;input /&gt; directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as &lt;p &gt; surround
                and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do
                not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
